# CYSE 270 – Linux Mastery Labs (Portfolio Repo)

**Purpose:** A portfolio-ready Linux lab repo to build real Linux skill alongside CYSE 270 and prepare for LPIC-1.

✅ These labs are **practice-only** unless your course explicitly requires submission.  
✅ Every lab includes: README, evidence placeholders, command logs, and reflection prompts.

## How to use
1. Pick the matching lab folder.
2. Take a VM snapshot: `LABXX-START`
3. Start logging (recommended): `script -a ~/cyse270/logs/lab-XX.log`
4. Complete steps and capture evidence:
   - screenshots in `evidence/screenshots/`
   - command outputs in `evidence/commands.log`
   - notes in `evidence/reflection.md`
5. End logging with `exit`, then commit.

## Evidence naming convention
- Screenshot: `lab-XX_step-YY_shortdesc.png`
- Commands: `commands.log`
- Reflection: `reflection.md`
