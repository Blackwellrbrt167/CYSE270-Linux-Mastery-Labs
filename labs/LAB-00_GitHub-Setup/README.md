# LAB-00 — GitHub Repo Setup (CYSE270 Linux Mastery Labs)

## Objective
Initialize local repo, connect to GitHub remote, and push baseline structure.

## Evidence (Screenshots)
1. pwd + ls (repo structure)
2. git status (clean working tree)
3. git remote -v (origin set correctly)
4. git push success output
5. GitHub repo page showing uploaded files

## Steps Taken (High Level)
- Navigated to local repo folder
- Initialized Git (if needed)
- Set branch to main
- Added remote origin
- Added initial commit
- Pushed to GitHub

## Notes / Lessons Learned
- Windows user profile paths vs OneDrive paths
- Fixing remote URL typos (owner/repo must match exactly)
